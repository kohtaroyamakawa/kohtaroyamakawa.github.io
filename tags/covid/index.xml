      <description>During Pandemic I wrote the following during the pandemic, in the summer of 2020.&#xA;_College graduation is supposed to be a landmark time. Pandemic&amp;rsquo;s are too. Having both at the same time was a bitch.&#xA;Being in college is always different. I felt the need of finding that 25th hour of the day and worked day and night with so little sleep that I would snooze at least once a class.</description>

      <description>The Technical side I have a huge project in the works with Ryan and James. I hope it will be out on arxiv before I head off to NYC on May 14th. It&amp;rsquo;s so exciting that I am spending a lot of time in Lab making sure I get measurements in and getting clean data. The computational projects using DFT or my readings have been pushed out of the way to get this project through.</description>

      <description>February was quite a wild ride.&#xA;The Technical side I really learned a ton of things here: In January, I focused on preparing samples for transport measurements while in February, I (re) learned how to do all the experiments I did in the past: Magnetization, transport (on a rotator), heat capacity, and even PXRD. Remembering the basics and how each one fits into a puzzle helped me figure out what I was looking for.</description>

      <description>And we&amp;rsquo;re back! Came back from almost a month break during which I played Taiko in LA, went to Ohio, and got covid&amp;hellip; so no science. Popped back in and hit the ground running pushing projects and getting used to doing research full time.&#xA;It feels great being able to accomplish and read things but it feels as if I run around all day making things happen and have one hour of concentrated work a day.</description>

      <description>I felt like I really got some momentum back in my research. A little late but a few highlights:&#xA;Restarted DFT calculations and getting into computational condensed matter&#xA;Started a Topological Order Reading Group with Kai and other friends in my year&#xA;Got to know my mentors and got closer to other research group members.&#xA;Decided to stick with James for my Phd&#xA;Finished up being a TA for Physics 141A: Solid State physics with Joe Orenstein</description>

      <description>Some quotes I enjoy.&#xA;&amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t like integrals&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;&#xA;Open a bottle when you win a grant. Drink every time something in the experiment fails.&#xA;Some weeks are just sad weeks. Whoops.&#xA;Writing an NSF proposal: Me to my advisor: &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Is this even true?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; My advisor: &amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; Probably&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;&#xA;I finished a reading course on Quantum Info Meets Quantum Matter by Xiao-Gang Wen along with a few friends that gave me a first glance into topological order.</description>

      <description>Academically This month, I spent my time doing a rotation with Mike Zaletel. I looked into Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method and topological order in the fractional quantum hall effect. I started to see how computationally nice one dimensional models are, how computationally hard two dimensional models are, and how hard three dimensions is. It fills me with a little sadness to know how hard it is to model three dimensional models.</description>

      <description>Alas we are finished! The first year of the PhD is finished and I am happy. Happy for it to be over. Happy for it to have happened. Many things have occurred in the past year that have made itâ€¦. interesting. Unprecedented, you might say.&#xA;I took Zoom classes and stayed indoor for the majority of the first half of the year. Fires raged outdoors, COVID ravaged the world, and I was left alone indoors.</description>

      <title>Taking Online Classes</title>

      <description>Finding a way to get through online classes whether you&amp;rsquo;re a teacher or a student is important. When you&amp;rsquo;re on a few or 10 Zoom meetings a day, here&amp;rsquo;s some things that helped me out in getting through. On average, I spent around 15 hours a week teaching, another 10-15 hours of watching talks and lectures, and a few mor hours to hang out with friends. Here&amp;rsquo;s some tips and tricks to help you get through the day!</description>

      <description>Some new things happened this week. I got permissions to start work at LBNL and on campus.&#xA;My became aware of the fantastic world of fractons, finally figured out what Tomonaga Luttinger liqudis were, and became more familiar with the Kitaev model. I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself getting more and more interested in 2D materials and finding out the connection between quantum spin liquids and other strongly correlated systems like unconventional superconductors. I am interested in how abelian/non-abelian anyons may come out of kitaev spin liquids and how they are related to the fact that the QSL must be described by a Conformal Field Theory with central charge c&amp;lt;1/2.</description>

      <title>Year 1: Winterbreak</title>

      <description>With COVID, I didn&amp;rsquo;t go home for the winter break. But I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sad. I got the Graduate Remote Instructor Fellowship to study different ways of planning for the (hopefully last) remote semester. I got to seemy partner a lot and explored Berkeley as much as we could. I even got work on my Taiko. It was nice.&#xA;Living alone Once my suite mate left for home in late November for the Thanksgiving holidays, I was by myself!</description>

      <description>Hello folks!&#xA;Welcome to the first posting in my PhD blog. I hope to continue this throughout my five year journey.&#xA;This last year has been an ordeal. I had graduated Columbia at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic taking my commencement ceremony sitting on my couch at home. We took the 2-3 hours to listen to the commencement ceremony and that was it: the ending of my undergraduate career. It felt a bit empty but it was that way for everyone.</description>
