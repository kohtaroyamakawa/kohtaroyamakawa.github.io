      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;during-pandemic&#34;&gt;&#xA;  During Pandemic&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;heading-link&#34; href=&#34;#during-pandemic&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;i class=&#34;fa-solid fa-link&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; title=&#34;Link to heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;    &lt;span class=&#34;sr-only&#34;&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wrote the following during the pandemic, in the summer of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;_College graduation is supposed to be a landmark time.&#xA;Pandemic&amp;rsquo;s are too.  Having both at the same time was a bitch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being in college is always different.  I felt the need of finding that 25th hour of the day and worked day and night with so little sleep that I would snooze at least once a class.  EVERY CLASS.  Between physics research, physics projects, and Taiko, I was stretched out thin and felt like I was always running to my next thing.  Even when I was &amp;ldquo;relaxing&amp;rdquo; by going to a cafe, I was there to work and catch up on other work.  It was hell and it was good.  I had more freedom than I had any other time of my life and I did what I wanted, when I wanted.  Then, March 2020 happened._&lt;/p&gt;</description>
