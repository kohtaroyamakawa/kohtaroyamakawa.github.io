      <description>Lucretius was a Roman poet and philospher born in 94 BC. He wrote a six volume work called De Rerum Natura or On the nature of things, written in dactylic hexameter and known to detail the main tenants of Epicureanism. It&amp;rsquo;s Book II has this passage in a section known as &amp;lsquo;The Dance of Atoms&amp;rsquo;.

These are some of the math/science articles and forum posts that stick in my brain the most! I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with everything written but each gave me something to think about.
