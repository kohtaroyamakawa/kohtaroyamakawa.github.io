      <description>I have taught many times over my years of playing Taiko. There&amp;rsquo;s always difficulties surrounding teaching when it comes to (1) teaching according to people&amp;rsquo;s levels, (2) not overloading students with details, (3) making it fun.
Teaching towards your students    Each student has their own collection of experiences. Some have taiko experiences, others have musical or dance training, and some have no experiences at all. While its often difficult trying to find a way to teach every student in a class, there is usually always some rudimentary skills that even veterans need to drill and always some territory of taiko that the student has yet to see.</description>
