I really learned a ton of things here:  In January, I focused on preparing samples for transport measurements while in February, I (re) learned how to do all the experiments I did in the past: Magnetization, transport (on a rotator), heat capacity, and even PXRD.  Remembering the basics and how each one fits into a puzzle helped me figure out what I was looking for.  There are a few things I have learned.">

<p>I really learned a ton of things here:  In January, I focused on preparing samples for transport measurements while in February, I (re) learned how to do all the experiments I did in the past: Magnetization, transport (on a rotator), heat capacity, and even PXRD.  Remembering the basics and how each one fits into a puzzle helped me figure out what I was looking for.  There are a few things I have learned.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get a working codebase to plot and see data from experiments faster.  Organization is key!  (I learned how to use Notion this month).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have an established workflow to do the things that are most important: talking science with collaboraters, asking questions to peers and mentors, sitting down with the data and thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make time for yourself: Experiments need to happen but so does your personal growth.  Make sure there is still time for you to read on your own and understand the literature.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This month, I did not have a good work-life balance.  err&hellip; I was able to hang out with my partner and go do Taiko things throughout the weekend.  BUT&hellip; I worked til midnight every weekday.  Unsure if that is okay or if I really just enjoy it.  I need to check in with myself to make sure I am going because I want to and no other reason.</p>
<p>I also learned how difficult it is to mentor a student.  It is not enough to know the material, but making the right time for them to learn things on their own and trying to keep them interested in a project&hellip; is hard to say the least.  James helped me out to make a plan for mentoring my undergraduate student and I hope that will put us back on track.</p>
