I wrote the following during the pandemic, in the summer of 2020.
_College graduation is supposed to be a landmark time.
Pandemic&rsquo;s are too.  Having both at the same time was a bitch.
Being in college is always different.  I felt the need of finding that 25th hour of the day and worked day and night with so little sleep that I would snooze at least once a class.  EVERY CLASS.  Between physics research, physics projects, and Taiko, I was stretched out thin and felt like I was always running to my next thing.  Even when I was &ldquo;relaxing&rdquo; by going to a cafe, I was there to work and catch up on other work.  It was hell and it was good.  I had more freedom than I had any other time of my life and I did what I wanted, when I wanted.  Then, March 2020 happened._">

<p>It&rsquo;s May 2022 now.  I&rsquo;m back in New York City to celebrate my makeup graduation ceremony for undergraduate at Columbia University.  As I walk the same cobblestones and halls of a life that felt forever ago, I found myself swept in a sea of nostalgia.  I recall every story from my undergraduate life in every little spot on campus: the coffee shop replaced by a chain, the classrooms repainted and renewed, another year of graduates talking about heir summer travel plans.  So much has changed.</p>
<p>Some hasn&rsquo;t.  I see the same faces of the workers in the bodegas I used to frequent, the professors and friends who stuck around, and the rush and bustle of a train station.  I walk the streets with a sense of nostalgia for all the days that have past with a simultaneous urge of alienation from the new change in time.</p>
<p>When the last quarter of our senior year to the pandemic, I didn&rsquo;t think much of it.  Or rather, I couldn&rsquo;t.  There was a sense of shock and a glazed over sense of &lsquo;ah well, bummer&rsquo; that kept me distanced from the feelings of loss.  After all, everyone I knew were feeling the same.  What is the point of complaining when we all understood the same pain.</p>
<p>But walking around today made me feel that sense of loss in a deeper way than before.  I didn&rsquo;t just lose the time to say goodbye to my friends but also the careless freedom that dominated my undergraduate life.</p>
<p>&hellip;Of leaving work for spontaneous meetups at
&hellip;Of ditching campus for random excursions into the New York night.
&hellip;Of discovering cafes and shops filled to the brim of unique and interesting art</p>
<p>I would love to say, &lsquo;I wish I knew it was the good times back then&rsquo;. In a sense, that would be easier.  But I knew.  I knew I was in the good times.  And it&rsquo;s still sad all the same.  Knowing you have it good doesn&rsquo;t make it any easier to leave.</p>
<p>Today was a fun day.  I met up with friends from undergrad and felt the friendships I left without closure reopen and ignite.  But I also feel saddened, exposed, nostalgic, alienated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first time I have truly felt I have missed this place: New York, Columbia University, and the me of that time.  It&rsquo;s a frightening how strong these feelings are.
And I know I will miss this feeling too when it goes away.</p>
