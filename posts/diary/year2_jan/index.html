        <p>And we&rsquo;re back!  Came back from almost a month break during which I played Taiko in LA, went to Ohio, and got covid&hellip; so no science.  Popped back in and hit the ground running pushing projects and getting used to doing research full time.</p>
<p>It feels great being able to accomplish and read things but it feels as if I run around all day making things happen and have one hour of concentrated work a day.  I&rsquo;ve been talking to Ryan Day, a postdoc in the Analytis group, and we both agree that we just need to start our computations before we arrive to work&hellip; which happens to be 8 or 9 am.  Oof.</p>
<p>I think I am enjoying everything greatly.  I feel proficient enough to do most tasks in crystal growth and transport/magnetization measurements.  However, the physics behind these techniques and the data are still a mystery to me as is creating a good schedule for me to not feel like I am behind.</p>
<p>I also got into mentoring my first undergraduate student.  It has been fun and also difficult, trying to find a balance between keeping them interested and intrigued by experiment work whilst learning basics.  I&rsquo;m having James help me plan how to mentor her so hopefully it goes well.  I also think that helping her learn</p>
<p>Hopefully, this second month of 2022 will be more deliberate and I will feel like I am truly making progress.</p>
