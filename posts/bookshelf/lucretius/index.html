        <p>Lucretius was a Roman poet and philospher born in 94 BC.  He wrote a  six volume work called <em>De Rerum Natura</em> or <em>On the nature of things</em>, written in dactylic hexameter and known to detail the main tenants of Epicureanism.  It&rsquo;s Book II has this passage in a section known as &lsquo;The Dance of Atoms&rsquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All bodies of matter are in motion. To understand this best,</p>
<p>Remember that the atoms do not have a place to rest,</p>
<p>And there’s no bottom to the universe, since Space does not</p>
<p>Have limits, but is endless. As I have already taught</p>
<p>And proved with reason irrefutable, it opens wide</p>
<p>And far in all directions, measureless on every side.</p>
<p>And therefore it is obvious no respite’s ever given</p>
<p>To atoms through the fathomless void but, rather, they are driven</p>
<p>By sundry restless motions. After colliding some will leap</p>
<p>Great intervals apart, while others harried by blows will keep</p>
<p>In a narrow space. Those atoms that are bound together tight,</p>
<p>When they collide with something, their recoil is only slight</p>
<p>Since they are tangled up in their own intricate formation:</p>
<p>Such are the particles that form the sturdy roots of stone,</p>
<p>And make up savage iron and other substances of this kind.</p>
<p>Of the other particles drifting through the vast deep, we find</p>
<p>A few leap far apart and bounce a long way back again,</p>
<p>Providing us with thin air and the shining of the sun.</p>
<p>And many more besides stray through the void, either out cast</p>
<p>From combinations, or which alliances could not hold fast</p>
<p>In harmonious motions.</p>
<pre><code>          There’s a model, you should realize,
</code></pre>
<p>A paradigm of this that’s dancing right before your eyes -</p>
<p>For look well when you let the sun peep in a shuttered room</p>
<p>Pouring forth the brilliance of its beams into the gloom,</p>
<p>And you’ll see myriads of motes all moving many ways</p>
<p>Throughout the void and intermingling in the golden rays</p>
<p>As if in everlasting struggle, battling in troops,</p>
<p>Ceaselessly separating and regathering in groups.</p>
<p>From this you can imagine all the motions that take place</p>
<p>Among the atoms that are tossed about in empty space.</p>
<p>For to a certain extent, it’s possible for us to trace</p>
<p>Greater things from trivial examples, and discern</p>
<p>In them the trail of knowledge. Another reason you should turn</p>
<p>You attention to the motes that drift and tumble in the light:</p>
<p>Such turmoil means that there are secret motions, out of sight,</p>
<p>That lie concealed in matter. For you’ll see the motes careen</p>
<p>Off course, and then bounce back again, by means of blows unseen,</p>
<p>Drifting now in this direction, now that, on every side.</p>
<p>You may be sure this starts with atoms; they are what provide</p>
<p>The base of this unrest. For atoms are moving on their own,</p>
<p>Then small formations of them, nearest them in scale, are thrown</p>
<p>Into agitation by unseen atomic blows,</p>
<p>And these strike slightly larger clusters, and on and on it goes -</p>
<p>A movement that begins on the atomic level, by slight</p>
<p>Degrees ascends until it is perceptible to our sight,</p>
<p>So that we can behold the dust motes dancing in the sun,</p>
<p>Although the blows that move them can’t be seen by anyone.</p>
<p>Translated by A.E. Stallings, in the Penguin edition (2007).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing about science always is a delicate balance between skipping over details to romanticize physics versus getting too technical.  I suppose that can be said about a lot of science writing.  I remember loving the vague imagery of <em>The arrow of Time</em> from Stephen Hawkings books or the <em>Rolled Up Dimensions</em> in Brian Greene&rsquo;s demonstrations.  But now I found most of those descriptions vague and sacrosanct.  Its rare to find a piece of science writing that I would enjoy both as a child and now.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, some say that this last section implies Lucretius observed Brownian motion, the phenomenon when seemingly random life-like movements of pollen grains in water (or any small object in liquid).  Here, Lucretius describes as dust lazily drifting in the sunlight.  Certainly a prettier picture than a muck of pollen grains.  But I feel that this poem also holds some gems that we can appreciate, albeit anachronistically.  There&rsquo;s something about</p>
<blockquote>
<p>atoms moving on their own&hellip; thrown into agitation by unseen atomic blows</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that feels like a prophecy of quantum fluctuations we study today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[M]ovements that [begin] on the atomic level, by slight Degrees ascends until it is perceptible to our sight</p>
</blockquote>
<p>feels like a glimpse into the modern phenomenon of Emergence, popularized by Anderson&rsquo;s piece <em>More is Different</em>.  Some days I wish that my day-to-day literature reading included such vivid and exciting imagery.</p>
<p>Maybe I should start reading more Epicurean poetry.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll put it in my papers.</p>
<p>A great posting about it that brought this to light and its relation to Brownian Motion can be found <a href="https://people.bath.ac.uk/ak257/LvB.html">here</a></p>
