<meta name="description" content="I visited LA in the week of June 5th to June 12th and had a blast!  A few awesome Taiko things that happened:

Stayed in Kris Bergstrom and Minh Nguyen&rsquo;s apartment and did jam sessions at his studio!
Participated in a UnitOne practice with Jen Baik, Young Kang, Fred Visaya, and Yuta Kato
Took a Hachijo and Odaiko/Naname/Yodan private lesson with Yuta Kato
Took an Odaiko private lesson with Isaku Kageyama
Took a Naname private lesson with Yeeman &ldquo;Manman&rdquo; Mui

My trip to LA was the first time I took a private lesson and the first time I felt I was making a step twoard progressing my Taiko skills and training in a meaninful way.  It was exhilarating talking to professionals who heard every nerdy thought I had about Taiko and consider them with complete consideration and seriousness.  I learned about artist expression, performance mind-set, odaiko soloing, the boundary between music and taiko, and the limitations of my own playing.  Can&rsquo;t wait to go back!">
