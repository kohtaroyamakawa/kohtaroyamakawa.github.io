      <description>I have taught many times over my years of playing Taiko. There&amp;rsquo;s always difficulties surrounding teaching when it comes to (1) teaching according to people&amp;rsquo;s levels, (2) not overloading students with details, (3) making it fun.
Teaching towards your students    Each student has their own collection of experiences. Some have taiko experiences, others have musical or dance training, and some have no experiences at all. While its often difficult trying to find a way to teach every student in a class, there is usually always some rudimentary skills that even veterans need to drill and always some territory of taiko that the student has yet to see.</description>

      <description>From December 3rd to December 12th, 2021 I was back in LA doing private lessons and learning Taiko. This time I was here for a specific reason: Recital + Concert! I took Yuta Kato&amp;rsquo;s Yodan Uchi class, Manman&amp;rsquo;s Quitiplas in the Pocket, and Isaku Kageyama&amp;rsquo;s Rei so that I could perform them in person at the biannual LATI Recial and the &amp;ldquo;Art of Taiko&amp;rdquo; Concert. My week was full with learning Taiko, meeting new Taiko people, and reconnecting with some old ones.</description>

      <description>Piece: Quitiplas in the Pocket
ManMan studied Quitiplas (ki-ti-pla) with Venezuelan artist Jackeline Rago in 2013. This music was originally created by the enslaved African-Venezuelan incorporating bamboo sticks when their drums were destroyed and banned by the enslavers. The polyrhythm in quitiplas celebrates freedom of expression and creates a musical conversation that builds community. Empowered by the essence of quitiplas, this taiko piece celebrates the joy of diversity in musical expression.</description>

Thoughts on my playing

  More crescendos and change the sound.</description>

Thoughts on my playing:
 Keep head up during the oroshi Don&amp;rsquo;t sway your hips so muchduring karaka M3 arm needs to be bigger loop Use more gravity to hit and less acceleration More ma during B section and more spacious rhythms Let the build be more flowy and less erratic More flashy/poses overall Create that golden moment by letting the bachi drop from the furthest point and contorting at the last Better lines on your feet: don&amp;rsquo;t lift the tips of your feet, just heel Glide, don&amp;rsquo;t just move Slower raise of the bachi, use delay and twirls to build atmosphere Way better than before LA trip but not quite where I want to be.</description>

      <description>A proposal to solve a problem I find myself in.
There is a awkward-nesss in American Taiko. When someone tries to join a Taiko group, it is an investment in time and energy. There is no established canon1 that you immediately play with this new group. You usually don’t know their repertoire. For the state of Taiko in America, where most groups only meet once a week, it is hard to join a group without investing a good deal of effort— as it should be!</description>

      <description>Learned and performed Jack Bazaar as part of Asano Taiko&amp;rsquo;s Virtual Recital. Had fun meeting Taiko enthusiasts from all over the world (Los Angeles, Berkeley, Little Rock, Calgary, Kawasaki, Buenos Aires) through online asynchronous lessons with Yuta Kato. I believe this was Asano Taiko/LATI&amp;rsquo;s first venture into complete virtual instruction.

      <description>Under inspiration from the superb personal site of Kris Bergstrom, I&amp;rsquo;ll start curating my first personal site on Taiko. I don&amp;rsquo;t aim really to give any instruction or information to any students but I might post some useful links and thoughts that I&amp;rsquo;ve had on my Taiko journey!
Documenting and publishing, albeit to an audience of measure zero, is a process that I want to immerse myself in both so that I can look back on my own progress in the future and maybe even organize my thoughts.</description>

      <title>Taiko as Music and Form</title>
      <link>https://kohtaroyamakawa.github.io/posts/taiko/musicandform/</link>

      <description>I recall the words of Tsuji Tasuku, member of Eitetsu Fuunkai: &amp;ldquo;If you play Taiko like a drumset, why don&amp;rsquo;t you use a drumset instead?&amp;rdquo; He didn&amp;rsquo;t mean that all Taiko pieces need to be loud, but that something about the Taiko must be essential to its playing. Indeed, utilizing nagado daiko, shime, or uchiwa to create a backbeat that is replaceable with a western drum set with the same effect, feels like a waste.</description>
