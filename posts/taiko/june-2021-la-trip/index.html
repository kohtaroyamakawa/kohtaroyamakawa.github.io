        <p>I visited LA in the week of June 5th to June 12th and had a blast!  A few awesome Taiko things that happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stayed in Kris Bergstrom and Minh Nguyen&rsquo;s apartment and did jam sessions at his studio!</li>
<li>Participated in a UnitOne practice with Jen Baik, Young Kang, Fred Visaya, and Yuta Kato</li>
<li>Took a Hachijo and Odaiko/Naname/Yodan private lesson with Yuta Kato</li>
<li>Took an Odaiko private lesson with Isaku Kageyama</li>
<li>Took a Naname private lesson with Yeeman &ldquo;Manman&rdquo; Mui</li>
</ul>
<p>My trip to LA was the first time I took a private lesson and the first time I felt I was making a step twoard progressing my Taiko skills and training in a meaninful way.  It was exhilarating talking to professionals who heard every nerdy thought I had about Taiko and consider them with complete consideration and seriousness.  I learned about artist expression, performance mind-set, odaiko soloing, the boundary between music and taiko, and the limitations of my own playing.  Can&rsquo;t wait to go back!</p>
