        <p>Finding a way to get through online classes whether you&rsquo;re a teacher or a student is important.  When you&rsquo;re on a few or 10 Zoom meetings a day, here&rsquo;s some things that helped me out in getting through.  On average, I spent around 15 hours a week teaching, another 10-15 hours of watching talks and lectures, and a few mor hours to hang out with friends.  Here&rsquo;s some tips and tricks to help you get through the day!</p>
<h1 id="1-optimize-your-setup">
  1. Optimize your setup.
  <a class="heading-link" href="#1-optimize-your-setup">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>If your wallet allows it, improve your setup.  Getting an ergonomic keyboard/mouse/chair/footrest is important to feel comfortable while working.  If weather permits, take a class outdoors. Being able to alternate different modes of taking in information is important to keep you on your toes and get the proper stretch you need.</p>
<h1 id="2-figure-out-how-you-are-going-to-teachlearn">
  2. Figure out how you are going to teach/learn
  <a class="heading-link" href="#2-figure-out-how-you-are-going-to-teachlearn">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>While having different modes of accepting information is important, too many degrees of freedom can distract you to no end.  If you have a dual monitor, try to focus on just one when a lecture is happening.  I go so far as turning off one of my monitors and locking my phone to try to concentrate on the lecture.  I still manage to find my phone in my hand looking at memes but definitely less frequently than before.</p>
<p>Sometimes, distracting yourself a bit helps too!  Another thing that helps me is, <em>turning on some music</em>.  Whether it be lofi hip hop beats or cafe jazz, something noisy in the background can help you wake up and concentrate on the task at hand.  I&rsquo;m surprised how little people seem to do this, but it has gotten me through some of my evening obligations. Try to use instrumental music or music in a language you don&rsquo;t know so that you don&rsquo;t end up listening to the music and distracting yourself completely.  Also that way, the speaker can&rsquo;t see you singing the lyrics or bopping your head.  But maybe they&rsquo;ll think that their presentation is just that good.</p>
<h1 id="3-turn-on-your-video-if-you-can">
  3. Turn on your video! (if you can)
  <a class="heading-link" href="#3-turn-on-your-video-if-you-can">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very common among students to turn off your video.  Sometimes that&rsquo;s appropriate, wheteher I&rsquo;m attending a class while making dinner or on a walk or not wearing all my clothes.However, from the teacher&rsquo;s perspective, lecturing to a blank screen is not only intimidating but soul crushing.  Anything that helps your lecturers have the will to continue pouring energy into their lectures is important and so I suggest that you put your video on if you can!</p>
<h1 id="4-take-a-break">
  4. Take a break!
  <a class="heading-link" href="#4-take-a-break">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>Take a break during lectures by getting up and stretching.  Take a break while you&rsquo;re  teaching to look outside and rest your eyes.  Take a break by skipping lecture and watching a recording later.  All of these are important in making sure that we can get up the next day or the next week to continue studying and working towards our dreams!</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">
  Conclusion
  <a class="heading-link" href="#conclusion">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>Zoom sucks! COVID sucks!  Life sucks when you have to do all of your studying and research alone in your room.  But it sucks for everyone else too.  We&rsquo;ll be free soon (hopefully).</p>
