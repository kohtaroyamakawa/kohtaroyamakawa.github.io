        <p>Some new things happened this week.
I got permissions to start work at LBNL and on campus.</p>
<p>My became aware of the fantastic world of fractons, finally figured out what Tomonaga Luttinger liqudis were, and became more familiar with the Kitaev model.  I&rsquo;ve found myself getting more and more interested in 2D materials and finding out the connection between quantum spin liquids and other strongly correlated systems like unconventional superconductors.
I am interested in how abelian/non-abelian anyons may come out of kitaev spin liquids and how they are related to the fact that the QSL must be described by a Conformal Field Theory with central charge c&lt;1/2.  While I am aware of the way permutations in majorana fermions may lead to a matrix which can encode a Non-abelian anyon, I don&rsquo;t understand how that physically manifests itself inside a system.  How do you create an anyon?  How real are majorana fermions?  I think many of these questions are experimental questions and can&rsquo;t wait to see more inside topological order.  I think more reading on toric code and plaquette operators will bring me better understanding&hellip; we&rsquo;ll see!</p>

<p>How can you tell if something is a quantum spin liquid?</p>
<p>What is a fractionalized quasiparticle and how physical it is relative to an ordered phase?</p>
<p>What is a Fermi Liquid quasiparticle far away from the Fermi surface?</p>
<p>How does QSL relate to px+ipy superconductivity?</p>
