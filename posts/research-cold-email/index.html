        <p><em>Writing cold emails suck</em></p>
<p>Balancing between the formality of talking to professors with a candid introduction is tricky.
The social anxiety of sending an email to a stranger sends shivers down my spine.
I&rsquo;ve sent my fair share of cold emails for starting research projects: here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

<b>The best cold email is no cold email at all.</b>

</h4>
<p>Unfortunately for those of us with limited social batteries, networking remains the best way to get to know a stranger.
If you know a mutual friend/professor/person who can introduce you, then your likelihood of getting a reply increases tenfold.
Just make sure you don&rsquo;t ask the same person for introductions too many times.</p>
<h4 id="ask-questions-about-a-presentation-they-gave">
  Ask questions about a presentation they gave.
  <a class="heading-link" href="#ask-questions-about-a-presentation-they-gave">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h4>
<p>Sometimes, a good way to strike up a conversation is to attend a presentation/lecture and follow up with them after (if you&rsquo;re in-person) or via email.  I&rsquo;ve found people are very open to talking about their recent presentations and that can be a way to wedge you foot in the door.</p>
<h4 id="take-one-of-their-classes-and-be-an-active-student">
  Take one of their classes and be an active student.
  <a class="heading-link" href="#take-one-of-their-classes-and-be-an-active-student">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h4>
<p>This is a long term investment but really is just an extended version of the point above.  Ask frequent questions in lecture, attend office hours to speak to them one on one, build a daily/weekly repoire.  Professors are people too and the more they know you, the more open they are to working with you.</p>
<h1 id="the-cold-email">
  The Cold Email
  <a class="heading-link" href="#the-cold-email">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>When you write an email, the first question you should ask is,</p>
<p><em>What do I want out of this conversation?</em></p>
<p>Do you want an advisor on a new kind of research?  Do you need advice on filling out an application?  Are you potentially interested in working with them in graduate school?
In the following, I will talk about composing an email with the last intention in mind. Adjustments for specific objectives should be made appropriately.</p>
<p>The most vital pieces of information that I believe should be in this email is:</p>
<h4 id="a-basic-introduction">
  A basic introduction
  <a class="heading-link" href="#a-basic-introduction">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>My name is INSERT_NAME and I am a INSERT_YEAR student at INSERT_COLLEGE.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="how-you-learned-about-them">
  How you learned about them
  <a class="heading-link" href="#how-you-learned-about-them">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h4>
<p>Did you attend their talks, take one of their classes, or read their published paper?  What brought you to their attention?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I attended your talk on INSERT_TOPIC and found its application to INSERT_APPLICATION revolutionary and exciting.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="their-specific-papers-and-what-interests-you-about-them">
  Their specific papers and what interests you about them
  <a class="heading-link" href="#their-specific-papers-and-what-interests-you-about-them">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h4>
<p>Show you know something about the topic and not just generically interested. Finding what&rsquo;s cool about a subject usually requires background reading and/or an awareness of the field of research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I found your recent paper INSERT_PAPER_TITLE particularly exciting because it INSERT_COOLNESS.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="your-own-experience-in-research-and-how-that-is-relevant">
  Your own experience in research and how that is relevant
  <a class="heading-link" href="#your-own-experience-in-research-and-how-that-is-relevant">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h4>
<p>Be honest about your experience in the field.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My previous work with INSERT_ADVISOR gave me an insight into INSERT_TOPIC because INSERT_RELEVANCE.
If you don&rsquo;t have any experience, it is best to say it here:
While I have not had any experience in working on INSERT_TOPIC, I am looking forward to reading up on.
It&rsquo;s not a bad idea to include a resume but do so only when it feels relevant.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="logistical-details">
  Logistical Details
  <a class="heading-link" href="#logistical-details">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h4>
<p>If you are contacting in reference to graduate school, when are you applying?  This can help a professor tell if they have the headspace/time/grants to support you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I plan on applying to INSERT_SCHOOL at INSERT_APPLICATION_SEASON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are contacting to work with them, are you applying to any fellowships?  If there&rsquo;s a chance that a professor doesn&rsquo;t need to support you financially, that makes it more likely for them to respond.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am planning on applying to the INSERT_FELLOWSHIP.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="plan-of-action">
  Plan of Action
  <a class="heading-link" href="#plan-of-action">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h4>
<p>Ask for a video call to chat or if you can go onsite, meet in person.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you by any chance have time to talk in-person/via video call sometime next week?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ask about grad students to talk to and follow up with about the group.  They are usually quite honest about the research and the atmosphere they work in.  It&rsquo;s a great way to figure out if you actually want to work with them!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would also love to talk to your students to know more about your group.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="thank-them">
  Thank them
  <a class="heading-link" href="#thank-them">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h4>
<p>By now you have made quite a long email.  If your recipient took the time to read through it all, thank them!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you!  Hope to see you soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="wrap-up">
  Wrap up
  <a class="heading-link" href="#wrap-up">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that following these rules have worked for me, specifically in the context of getting research advisors or making connections over email.  I&rsquo;d like to think that this advice is still relevant to other fields!</p>
<p>Hope it helps!</p>
